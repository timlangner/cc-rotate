//! The swap protocol (spec section 6).
//!
//! Ordering is what makes this safe against Claude Code's token refresh:
//! 1. cc-rotate's own swap lock serializes swaps across processes.
//! 2. Claude Code's two refresh locks are held while the outgoing login is captured and the
//!    target login is written, so no refresh can be in flight. A refresh that finished before
//!    we took the locks is in the file and gets captured; one that starts after we release them
//!    re-reads the file under the lock and refreshes the target.
//! 3. Claude Code's credentials write lock (`.storage-write.lock`) is held for the read and
//!    write as well, so no other read-modify-write of the credentials (an MCP login, say) can
//!    put the outgoing login back.
